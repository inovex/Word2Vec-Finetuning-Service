These are all just thoughts, and definitly not better than the existing code! :)
You might take https://github.com/inovex/AutoTiM as template.
### Structure and Code

- Take AutoTiM structure as template
- remove Debug and TODO comments in main
- remove print statemts or transform them to log statements
- Logging in general
- error Handling - try except (catch Errors)
  - pipeline.py
- Return Message: Status is the HTTP Code and (Error)Message might be the the text.
### General
- Expand ReadMe
- So far no tests, are you planning to write some?
- Repo size 909.81 MiB, definitely too much. Why is that so?
  - Maybe DVC
  - or link to hugging face
  - https://github.com/inovex/multi2convai/tree/main/models
- Maybe a temp file for the data upload and not saving it?
## Questions
- Why are the HTTP Methods GET and POST for all endpoints?
